## Why 
There are many example projects for flutter, but as soon as I digged deeper in developing flutter projects,
I realised, these examples have the following problems :
* Too simple
* Not practical in real life
* Just scratching the surface of flutter

This project is here to fix that!

## Install

Sorting a list of objects by different filters. The example contains a list of cars that can be filtered in different ways.

### Reading json file

### Managing favorites in shared preferences
Mark items from a list as your favorite and save the favorites in the shared preferences. The example contains a list of meals.
Each meal can be marked as favorite.
